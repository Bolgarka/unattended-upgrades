=== `unattended-upgrades` ===

This charm provides a subordinate service you can add to any master
service to keep all packages up-to-date automatically, using the
`unattended-upgrades` package.

    $ juju deploy <master>
    $ juju deploy unattended-upgrades
    $ juju add-relation <master> unattended-upgrades

=== Limitations ===

Currently, no configuration is provided: unattended-upgrades provides the
ability to select specific archives and origins for upgrading, but this
package does not expose that functionality.

`unattended-upgrades` does not upgrade packages with configuration changes
to conffiles. This should be rare.

Neither `unattended-upgrades` nor this charm will re-start services to use
new libraries or executables. TODO: Check on libc upgrades. They might
restart services.
